One of my first c# projects

Very simple console app. Nothing special.

1. Gives you Serpentine Discord link
2. Gives you Serpentine VRChat Group link
3. You don't wanna know
4. Exits the console

Literally anything else gives you a super-duper cool error message and then resets the console until you pick a valid option.
